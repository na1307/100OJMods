<0000> U-um, Mister Pomeranius? Where's Miss Arnelle? W-we made plans to go out shopping today...
// (pomeranius)
<0001> Alas, M'lady has her hands full containing that wild child.
// (watty)
<0002> Oh no... Maynie did seem kind of jealous when she agreed to come with me... I'm sorry for causing problems. I'll... I'll just go home.
// (pomeranius)
<0003> Fear not. M'lady has appointed me to be your concierge for the day.
// (watty)
<0004> O-oh, I couldn't ask you to do that, Mr. Pomeranius.
// (pomeranius)
<0005> Correct, but M'lady can, and has. She has also instructed me to treat you with the care and respect I would reserve for her.
// (watty)
<0006> Mr. Pomeranius, I-I can hear you grinding your teeth from here...
// (pomeranius)
<0007> Grrr. I simply have something stuck in my fangs. Let's be off, then. The sooner begun, the sooner done.
// (watty)
<0008> Oh no... I wish I could just sink to the bottom of the sea.
// (pomeranius)
<0009> If I might be so bold, why do you require M'lady's support for a simple shopping trip?
// (watty)
<0010> Oh, um, well... I-I don't come into town very often, actually, so shopping is a big deal. My body causes all sorts of problems.
// (pomeranius)
<0011> How so?
// (watty)
<0012> Well, um... You see over there, where there's a bunch of broken glass and trash on the ground?
// (pomeranius)
<0013> Grrr. How unsightly. These people live like animals.
// (watty)
<0014> Mr. Pomeranius, you are an animal...
// (pomeranius)
<0015> That's irrelevant. Even a dog can live with dignity.
// (watty)
<0016> A-anyway, because my whole body is in contact with the ground, I could really hurt myself on something like that. And I get so filthy just from moving around. It makes me feel hideous.
// (pomeranius)
<0017> You can't simply clean yourself with magic?
// (watty)
<0018> I-I could... but people get worried when they see you casting magic spells in town...
// (pomeranius)
<0019> Hrumph. Today, clean yourself as necessary. If anybody dares to speak out of line, they shall taste my claws.
// (watty)
<0020> Thank you, Mr. Pomeranius. That helps a lot. If I'm dirty when I go into the shop, the shopkeepers give me such awful looks...
// (watty)
<0021> I'm sorry for being a dirty, smelly fish woman.
// (pomeranius)
<0022> It sounds like we need only seek a better class of shopkeep. The ones you speak of seem unworthy of the profession.
// (watty)
<0023> I also need to carry lots of water to stop from drying out, and it's so heavy... Ah!
// (pomeranius)
<0024> Hold. There's glass on the floor here. I shall clear it away. Fish wo- ah. I mean, "m'lady", what are we shopping for first?
// (watty)
<0025> Um... I was thinking... it might be nice to look at some shirts. I love looking at cute clothes, but none of them are made to account for my body...
// (pomeranius)
<0026> Then we shall simply have them made bespoke. Come. I shall introduce you to m'lady's tailor.
// (watty)
<0027> Oh, thank you very much... W-wait. Miss Arnelle's tailor?
// (pomeranius)
<0028> Woof. Yes, I personally guarantee their skills.
// (watty)
<0029> S-so they make the... kinds of clothes that Miss Arnelle usually wears?
// (pomeranius)
<0030> Just so.
// (watty)
<0031> E-even the low-cut maid outfit, and the school uniform? A-And the... um... the 'casino infiltration gear'?
// (pomeranius)
<0032> Casino infiltration...? Ah, the bunny suit. M'lady is quite fond of it. She says it makes her feel but one step away from sagehood.
// (watty)
<0033> M-M-M-Mr. Pomeranius, we can't go to that tailor! Miss Arnelle's outfits are so, um, daring, and there's no way somebody like me could ever...
// (pomeranius)
<0034> Nonsense. Throw out your chest and raise your head. You are a member of Team Arnelle, and M'lady and I have invested our time into you. Walk with pride, Watty.
// (watty)
<0035> Actually, I kind of slither... W-wait, what I mean is, this and that are separate things. I just can't dress the way Miss Arnelle does. I'd die of shame.
// (pomeranius)
<0036> Oho? Are you saying M'lady's fashion sense is shameful?
// (watty)
<0037> No, but-
// (pomeranius)
<0038> Then come. Though I'm sure you will not reach the heights of M'lady, a new wardrobe will make you look quite the catch.
// (watty)
<0039> T-thank you, Mr. Pomeranius, but...
// (pomeranius)
<0040> Oho. If you wish to thank me, then I shall allow you to brush my coat later.
// (watty)
<0041> T... thanks...?
// (pomeranius)
<0042> It's usually M'lady's exclusive privilege, but... I understand now that grooming presents unique challenges for both you and I. I shall trust you with my gorgeous fur.
// (watty)
<0043> But, um...
// (pomeranius)
<0044> And, though I hesitate to say this... you may call for my services on future shopping trips, should you wish to.
// (watty)
<0045> I really appreciate that you're being so nice, Mr. Pomeranius, but...
// (pomeranius)
<0046> But?
// (watty)
<0047> There's still no way I can wear a b-b-bunny suit!!!
// (pomeranius)
<0048> Nonsense. Consider it a vital exercise in building your confidence.
// (watty)
<0049> But Mr. Pomeranius!! How are you expecting me to wear tights and high heels when I have no legs?!
// (pomeranius)
<0050> The same way we should endeavour to face all challenges as M'lady's followers: with poise, and dignity. Onwards, Watty!
// (watty)
<0051> Ahhhh... please, let me goooooo...
