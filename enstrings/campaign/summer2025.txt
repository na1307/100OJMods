// CampaignScenario_Event_Summer2025Intro
// (starb)
<0000> I'm here to see a genius mechanic named Tomato. Are they home?
// (tomato)
<0001> That's me. Who are you?
// (starb)
<0002> I'm Star Breaker. I want you to make me strong. Strong enough to destroy this world.
// (tomato)
<0003> Hmm, well. Mimyuu and I are about to head out to the beach. I'll get you what you want if you come along and play with us until we're satisfied.
// (tomato)
<0004> Mimyuu, you don't mind having her, right?
// (mimyuu)
<0005> No sweat, Boss! The more the merrier!
// (starb)
<0006> Play at the beach? What are you going to do exactly?
// (tomato)
<0007> We're gonna be standing upright on a banana boat as it glides on the water, playing beach volleyball against my Waruda machine, and cracking a hundred watermelons with explosives.
// (mimyuu)
<0008> After the blasts, the whole beach will look like a bloodbath!
// (starb)
<0009> That's completely ridiculous. Are you two out of your minds?
// (mimyuu)
<0010> You can't be in the Waruda crew if you're sane, you silly gal!
// (tomato)
<0011> So, what's it gonna be? If you're gonna be playing with us, you'll get what you want. If not, you won't.
// (starb)
<0012> Ugh, fine. I'll play with you.
// (tomato)
<0013> Alright then, you go home and come back with your swimsuit. And when you're back here, we're off to the beach.
// (starb)
<0014> S-swimsuit? I think what I'm wearing now is fine.
// (mimyuu)
<0015> Uh-uh, that's a no-no! You've got to be in a swimsuit at the beach!
// (starb)
<0016> Fine...
// (mimyuu)
<0017> Heck yeah, we're here!
// (tomato)
<0018> Alright, we're gonna play 'til we can't move!
// (starb)
<0019> I know this is all for my power-ups, but I still can't believe you've made me wear this... You better keep your promise.
// (tomato)
<0020> Of course, I'm a woman of my word.
// (tomomo)
<0021> Hey, Tomato! Are you really gonna make Star Breaker stronger?
// (tomato)
<0022> Huh? Well, yeah. Only after she finishes playing with me and Mimyuu, though. Wait, how do you know that?
// (saki)
<0023> I overheard you girls discussing that as I happened to be walking around your place! I decided it was something Tomomo should know!
// (kae)
<0024> I was hanging out with Tomomo and kinda followed her up here.
// (starb)
<0025> What, are you people here to stop me from becoming more powerful?
// (tomomo)
<0026> Duh! Like I'd just sit back and watch you wreck my world!
// (saki)
<0027> By the way, Star Breaker, your swimsuit is pretty cute. Where did you buy it?
// (kae)
<0028> I was thinking that, too. It looks really good on her.
// (starb)
<0029> Is that so? Thank you.
// (tomomo)
<0030> Come on, guys, can't we be serious for like one second!?
// (mimyuu)
<0031> Boo. Too long; didn't hear. Mimyuu's here to play.
// (tomato)
<0032> If Star Breaker keeps her promise, then I'll keep mine. No matter what you guys say!
// (tomomo)
<0033> Argh, I guess we have no choice. Saki, Kae, get ready to fight!
// (???)
<0034> Yes!\nOkay!
// (starb)
<0035> Okay, come. I'll crush all of you. Ahahahaha!
// (mimyuu)
<0036> Ooh, things are really heating up around here!
// (tomato)
<0037> Challenge accepted!

// CampaignScenario_Event_Summer2025Ending
// (tomomo)
<0038> Dang it, they got us...
// (kae)
<0039> It went kaboon, and then thud thud thud, and then bang bang baaang!
// (saki)
<0040> Mauu... How's she that strong...
// (starb)
<0041> Ahahaha!\nI can't believe weaklings like you people thought you had a chance!
// (tomato)
<0042> Uooooooh! We just fought the most amazing battle ever! Don't you think so, Mimyuu?
// (mimyuu)
<0043> Yeah, Boss! That was the best beach experience Mimyuu has ever had!
// (tomato)
<0044> Now that Star Breaker kept her word and played with us, it's my turn to get her what she wants.
// (starb)
<0045> Oh, that made you happy? You should've told me sooner.
// (tomomo)
<0046> Tomato, no! If the world gets wrecked, it'll put you in trouble, too!
// (tomato)
<0047> Well, I'll figure something out when it actually happens. Alright, let's go home and get some work done!
// (tomato)
<0048> ...And I'm finished! Put this on, and you'll get the power to destroy the world in a breeze!
// (mimyuu)
<0049> Wow, Boss! You whipped up a monster weapon like it was nothing! Absolute genius!
// (starb)
<0050> Okay, let's put that thing on... Hold on a second. What kind of joke is this?
// (tomato)
<0051> What's the problem?
// (starb)
<0052> That is clearly a swimsuit - one made with an extremely minimal amount of fabric.
// (tomato)
<0053> Yep, it is. I made it inspired by that epic battle back at the beach!
// (starb)
<0054> You have to stop fooling around. There's no way I'm wearing something that embarrassing. Make me something else, now.
// (tomato)
<0055> No can do. I'm out of materials, and I did keep my promise. I made you something powerful enough to destroy the whole world.
// (mimyuu)
<0056> She's absolutely right! She did her part perfectly!
// (starb)
<0057> Ugh, you even made me wear my swimsuit for this stupid thing. I wasted the whole day today... You two must pay for it.
// (tomato)
<0058> What? Wait, why do you look like you're about to attack us?
// (mimyuu)
<0059> Boss, this is bad! We better run!
// (starb)
<0060> Ahahaha! I'm going to destroy everything!
// (tomato)
<0061> Oh nooo! Knock it off!
// (mimyuu)
<0062> Heeeeh!
