<0000> I'm going to get going. It's getting late.
// (tsih)
<0001> Nfufu. Sure you're not just trying to skip out on Sherry's plane stories again?
// (alte)
<0002> That's... not necessarily the case.
// (tsih)
<0003> Once she's had a drink or two, she'll go on forever once she gets on that topic.
// (kyoko)
<0004> *Sigh*... And you're always the one who gets her on that topic.
// (tsih)
<0005> Nfufu. Guilty as charged. She has fun, and it's funny watching you two squirm.
// (kyoko)
<0006> They're fine stories, but I've heard all of them by now.
// (tsih)
<0007> Hey, Sherry! Tell us about that one time you were flying and the engine dropped straight out of the bottom of the plane!
// (sherry)
<0008> Oh, that old story? Well, my old pops and I were in the workshop...
// (kyoko)
<0009> *Sigh*... Alte, I'll hold the line. Escape while you can.
// (alte)
<0010> Understood. I'll buy you a drink next time.
// (alte)
<0011> Ah... It's cold. Even my breath is fogging up. I suppose it's that time of year.
// (alte)
<0012> Hm? Is that a child? At this time of night?
// (nico)
<0013> Ahhh! Santa, why do you have to leave everything till the last minute every time?!
// (alte)
<0014> Excuse me. Are you okay? Where are your parents?
// (nico)
<0015> Whoa! Stranger danger! Stranger danger!
// (alte)
<0016> I'm not here to hurt you. But... I can't leave a child by themselves on such a cold night.
// (nico)
<0017> Nico may be a child, but she's plenty responsible! Actually, Nico's at work right now!
// (alte)
<0018> You've been sent out to work? At your age? Even during times of war, that kind of thing is unacceptable.
// (nico)
<0019> Um, your aura just got really scary...
// (alte)
<0020> Sorry. I'd just like to speak to your parents. Immediately.
// (nico)
<0021> Ah, geez! Nico doesn't have time for this right now! If she doesn't hurry up, Christmas is going to be ruined!
// (alte)
<0022> Christmas?
// (nico)
<0023> That dummy Santa had another last minute emergency... If Nico doesn't help shore up her toy supply, children all around the world will end up without presents this year!
// (alte)
<0024> (Is this... some kind of make-believe game she's playing? But even so, she's still alone this late at night...)
// (alte)
<0025> ...I suppose there's nothing else for it. I'll help.
// (nico)
<0026> Wait, really?
// (alte)
<0027> The sooner your errand is done, the sooner we can get you back home safe. I'd be a failure of an adult if I left you alone.
// (nico)
<0028> Hmm.... Well, Nico did need a little muscle... Okie! Nico hereby deputizes you as one of Santa's Helper's Helpers!
// (alte)
<0029> ...Right. What's our objective?
// (nico)
<0030> First, we need to go to the All-Night Toy Shoppe.
// (alte)
<0031> (All-Night Toy Shoppe? Does that actually exist?)
// (nico)
<0032> When we get there, we need to pick up fifty Cuddle-Me-Lulus, sixty units of Miu's Bass Fishing, and a full case of Teotoratamogochis!
// (alte)
<0033> What? That's a huge amount. Do you have money for all that?
// (nico)
<0034> Nico's got plenty! Since she's on Christmas business, she's got a portion of Santa's budget.
// (alte)
<0035> If you're sure... Let's go, then.
// (nico)
<0036> All right!
// (alte)
<0037> Nico, wait!
// (nico)
<0038> Huhwha?
// (alte)
<0039> You almost walked right out into the middle of the road... It's not safe. Hold my hand while you cross.
// (nico)
<0040> Nico can cross the road just fine by herself! She's already twelve, you know. But fine! If it'll make you happy.
// (alte)
<0041> You're twelve...? You look younger than that.
// (nico)
<0042> Grr! It's a big problem! Nobody treats Nico seriously!
// (alte)
<0043> Well... you'll be happy for it when you're my age.
// (nico)
<0044> How old are you, lady?
// (alte)
<0045> Old enough.
// (nico)
<0046> Hmm... Ahh! Time's already ticking away. Here, grab Nico's hand and let's move out!
// (alte)
<0047> Right. ...Oh.
// (nico)
<0048> What's the matter now, lady?
// (alte)
<0049> ...It's nothing. Let's hurry.
// (nico)
<0050> Now you're speaking Nico's language!
// (nico)
<0051> Okay! We got everything on the list, and Nico checked it twice! Great work, lady!
// (alte)
<0052> I wasn't expecting you to jump on the counter and start haggling the price down.
// (nico)
<0053> Well, Nico's family works in the toy industry, after all. Nico's more impressed that you can carry all that stuff by yourself.
// (alte)
<0054> Don't underestimate a career soldier when it comes to lugging equipment around.
// (nico)
<0055> Wow, you make it sound so cool, too.
// (alte)
<0056> Still... this is a lot for one little girl. What were you planning to do if I didn't come along?
// (nico)
<0057> N-Nico would have made it work somehow...
// (alte)
<0058> I see. Nico, may I ask you something?
// (nico)
<0059> Sure.
// (alte)
<0060> Why are you doing this? It seems like an awful lot of work for somebody your age.
// (nico)
<0061> Hmm... Well, at first, Nico was just doing it to pay back her debt to society.
// (alte)
<0062> Debt to society? You're twelve.
// (nico)
<0063> But nowadays... Nico just likes it when Santa pats her on the head and says she's a good girl. Don't tell anybody that, though! Promise!
// (alte)
<0064> ...I see. I promise.
// (nico)
<0065> And... well. Santa exists for the sake of children. One day, Nico's going to grow up, and her relationship with Santa will change.
// (alte)
<0066> ...
// (nico)
<0067> Nico's sure we'll stay close, but... It's better to make the most of our time right now!
// (alte)
<0068> ...Indeed. Nico, I may not be Santa, but I think you're a good kid.
// (nico)
<0069> Fweee! Nico thinks you're a great adult, too. Way cooler than certain bunnies who leave everything to the last minute.
// (alte)
<0070> Well. Just because I'm an adult, it doesn't mean I have all the answers. We struggle, too.
// (nico)
<0071> Really?
// (alte)
<0072> Of course. ...Are you sure it's okay to leave the toys here?
// (nico)
<0073> Sure! Santa's going to airlift them out of here. Nico's house is just over there, too.
// (alte)
<0074> Understood. Well, this is goodbye, then. It was nice meeting you, Nico.
// (nico)
<0075> Thanks for all your help, lady! You were a great minio- Nico means, helper!
// (alte)
<0076> My name is Alte. Stay safe, Nico. Be good.
// (alte)
<0077> (What a strange girl. She was such a hard worker, and she had so much energy... and her hands were so small.)
// (alte)
<0078> (She smiled a lot, too... If he and I had been blessed with a child, I wonder if they would have turned out like her.)
// (alte)
<0079> Kids... sure are something special. I ended up doing extra work, but... I'm happy. At least I'll have a story to tell Tsih and the others when we next meet up.
