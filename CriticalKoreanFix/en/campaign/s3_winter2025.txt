// (kurie)
<0000> A 100% OJ club, huh.
// (poyo)
<0001> Yes, Ms. Kurie! I'm sure this way we'll get the most out of our youth!
// (kurie)
<0002> I fully support you starting your own club. I believe it'll be a valuable experience for everyone involved.
// (kurie)
<0003> But...
// (poyo)
<0004> What is it, Ms. Kurie?
// (kurie)
<0005> There already was a 100% OJ club, but it's been disbanded for two years.
// (poyo)
<0006> Fue!? Really?
// (kurie)
<0007> Yeah. They were on a roll and kept on winning.
// (poyo)
<0008> Why did such a club shut down?
// (kurie)
<0009> That was because...
// (unknown)
<0010> Did someone just say '100% OJ club?'
// (poyo)
<0011> Fue?
// (kurie)
<0012> Oh.
// (popomi)
<0013> You're not going to start a 100% OJ club again, are you?
// (poyo)
<0014> Well, um.
// (kurie)
<0015> She's Mari Popomi, a third-year.
// (poyo)
<0016> A third-year... So, she's older than me!?
// (popomi)
<0017> Got a problem?
// (poyo)
<0018> (I thought she was a first-year because she's so short.)
// (kurie)
<0019> Talk about good timing. No one's better suited to explain the past of the 100% OJ club than Mari.
// (poyo)
<0020> Um, why's that?
// (kurie)
<0021> She was a member.
// (poyo)
<0022> Really!?
// (kurie)
<0023> If you want to start a 100% OJ club, that's why you should talk to her, Oage.
// (popomi)
<0024> No talks are necessary. Popo will thoroughly teach you just how dangerous 100% OJ is!
// (poyo)
<0025> 100% OJ is dangerous?!
// (poyo)
<0026> So that's what happened...
// (chuu)
<0027> And now this is happening, huh.
// (popomi)
<0028> 100% OJ is a dangerous game! And the only way I can show you that is by actually playing it...
// (popomi)
<0029> So Popo is here to risk her life to teach you all the dangers of the game!
// (kanata)
<0030> Oh, she's the overly-enthusiastic type...
// (haruka)
<0031> I don't hate that.
// (mimomo)
<0032> Well, sorry, girls, but would you play with Popomi for me?
// (chuu)
<0033> And can I ask why you're here, student council president?
// (mimomo)
<0034> Because I heard Popomi was gonna do something fun around here♥
// (popomi)
<0035> Mimo's a beginner at the board game, so I'll pair up with her. That'd give you guys a fair advantage against me.
// (poyo)
<0036> So, the two of you are going to play a match of 100% OJ against us, correct?
// (popomi)
<0037> Don't you take it lightly! This is no laughing matter!
// (chuu)
<0038> She seems serious and enthusiastic at the same time.
// (mimomo)
<0039> She's lots of fun, ain't she?
// (poyo)
<0040> A-anyway, we have to beat you in the game to start our 100% OJ club, is that right?
// (popomi)
<0041> You can take it that way if you wish.
// (poyo)
<0042> Alright then... We'll give it everything we've got to win this match for the sake of our youth!
// (mimomo)
<0043> Wow.
// (popomi)
<0044> Looks like you've got the guts, at least...!

// CampaignScenario_Event_Season3_Part2_Ending
// (popomi)
<0045> Great. Come, show me what you're made of!
// (popomi)
<0046> Ugh... Argh!!!
// (poyo)
<0047> Po-Popomi, what's wrong!?
// (mimomo)
<0048> Popochi, don't push yourself, okay?
// (popomi)
<0049> N-now you guys understand how dangerous the board game is, don't you...?
// (poyo)
<0050> Not in the slightest...
// (popomi)
<0051> Popo used to be a great 100% OJ player. So great she was even selected as the game's mascot.
// (poyo)
<0052> You were the game's mascot!? Does that mean you were Marie Poppo!?
// (chuu)
<0053> The mascot known by every 100% OJ player back then...!?
// (kanata)
<0054> And loved by every player.
// (haruka)
<0055> I was a big fan back then... Were you really...?
// (popomi)
<0056> Look at Popo, it's obvious, isn't it!? How could you not notice!?
// (poyo)
<0057> The Marie Poppo that I knew was pretty short, just like a real mascot...
// (mimomo)
<0058> Popochi's gotten pretty tall in the last two years.
// (popomi)
<0059> Yeah, Popo's height's 1 meter taller now! But it wouldn't make such a difference, would it!?
// (chuu)
<0060> Yes, it would!!!
// (poyo)
<0061> (She's still short, though.)
// (popomi)
<0062> Oh well. It doesn't matter now anyway.
// (popomi)
<0063> What Popo wants you to realize is how dangerous the board game is...
// (popomi)
<0064> Ever since they chose Popo as the mascot, she'd been working hard to hold on to the title.
// (popomi)
<0065> She underwent special training to stay the excellent player she was - rolling dice ten thousand times a day.
// (popomi)
<0066> And then one day, sharp pain struck her wrist.
// (popomi)
<0067> It was tendonitis... and it made Popo unable to roll a die.
// (popomi)
<0068> Without dice, 100% OJ cannot be played...
// (popomi)
<0069> And that was how Popo left the community of the board game and the 100% OJ club here got disbanded.
// (popomi)
<0070> Popo's wrist is much better now... But if you keep rolling dice, you'll end up like her... Ugh!
// (poyo)
<0071> Popomi...
// (kanata)
<0072> You know you don't have to roll a dice ten thousand times a day in order to play 100% Orange Juice.
// (popomi)
<0073> What!?
// (chuu)
<0074> Kana, you could've been less blunt.
// (kanata)
<0075> That is, without a doubt, the cause of her wrist injury, though.
// (popomi)
<0076> So it's not 100% OJ that's dangerous, but it's Popo's special training... Is that what you're saying??
// (poyo)
<0077> Um, I admire your efforts!
// (mimomo)
<0078> Well, after being picked as Miss Mascot, she just felt this huge pressure and couldn't help doing something. So, please don't judge her, 'kay?
// (haruka)
<0079> After hearing all that, I can kind of relate.
// (poyo)
<0080> None of us here ever had an amazing title like yours. All we wanna do is play our favorite board game to get the most out of our youth.
// (popomi)
<0081> Get the most out of your... youth?
// (poyo)
<0082> Yes. We want to set up a 100% OJ club where we can play the board game with many different people. Where everybody enjoys both winning and losing.
// (poyo)
<0083> We're certain that'll be the most valuable way we can spend our youth.
// (poyo)
<0084> That's why we wanna have our 100% OJ club!
// (poyo)
<0085> We promise we won't roll dice too many times, so no worries.
// (popomi)
<0086> ...You'll become just like me if you go even a little too far in dice-rolling, you understand that?
// (kanata)
<0087> I'll make sure that doesn't happen.
// (popomi)
<0088> Hmph, fine.
// (popomi)
<0089> You're all determined, you're all on good terms, and you won't be rolling too many dice.
// (popomi)
<0090> If so, Popo has no reason to stop you.
// (poyo)
<0091> Popo...!
// (popomi)
<0092> Go ahead and play 100% OJ to have the best youth ever.
// (poyo)
<0093> Yes!
// (mimomo)
<0094> Oh, looks like things have been settled and everyone's happy. Pretty neat.
// (popomi)
<0095> But! Now that Popo's played a game with you guys, she has to say none of you are anywhere near her level! And that means your youth will be filled with nothing but losses!
// (poyo)
<0096> What!?
// (popomi)
<0097> So Popo will join the club and train you guys!
// (poyo)
<0098> Are you sure!?
// (chuu)
<0099> So we're gonna have Miss 100% OJ mascot as a club member?
// (mimomo)
<0100> Popochi's back to being a 100% OJ player, huh. That's so neat! I'm all for it.
// (mimomo)
<0101> I suppose I'll join it too, then.
// (popomi)
<0102> Don't forget you're the student council president.
// (mimomo)
<0103> I can handle both. I'm a pretty good multitasker.
// (poyo)
<0104> We'd welcome you to the club.
// (haruka)
<0105> Yeah. It'll be more fun having you, for sure.
// (popomi)
<0106> Popo's fine with that if you guys are.
// (mimomo)
<0107> Hooray! Let's make our youth the best it can be, girls!
// (poyo)
<0108> Alright, the 100% OJ club of Shiny Sparkling Academy is back!!!
// (everyone)
<0109> Yeah!!
// (rinse)
<0110> Oh my, Marie Poppo is back to playing 100% OJ again...
// (suishou)
<0111> It seems like it. I believe it'll have an impact on the community of the game.
// (rinse)
<0112> Fufufu, I'll take that as a positive development if it helps liven the community more.
// (rinse)
<0113> Remind me: What school is Marie attending, again?
// (suishou)
<0114> It's Shiny Sparkling Academy, I believe.
// (rinse)
<0115> Shiny Sparkling Academy... Wait, isn't that...
// (rinse)
<0116> Excuse me. I have a text message.
// (rinse)
<0117> Oh my, it's from Haru.
// (suishou)
<0118> That childhood friend of yours?
// (rinse)
<0119> That's right. She has a twin sister, and they're both so adorable. I treat them like my real little sisters and... Oh my goodness!
// (suishou)
<0120> What's wrong?
// (rinse)
<0121> Suishou, we're going to ask Shiny Sparkling Academy for a practice match of 100% OJ.
// (suishou)
<0122> O-okay...!
