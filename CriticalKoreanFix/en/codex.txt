< LORE_MESCAL >
1=Mescal's date and place of birth are unknown.  Without letting that fact bother her, she's been raised up by the sky pirate Captain Tequila and his rowdy pirate gang as an innocent and wild girl.

3=Apart from his old friends Grain and Bourbon, few understand what he actually thinks (which isn't to say he's always full of deep thoughts). The only thing Malt doesn't like about Grain is that Grain refuses to grab a drink with him, so he tries to talk him into it every time he has a chance (and then gets turned down). 
4=Malt and Bourbon worked together to build up the Guild, but ended up opposing each other; however, they do only when it comes to the skies, so if they run into each other at a bar, they spend all night drinking together. By the way, the cane he uses is just for show.
