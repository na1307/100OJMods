<0000> Like this.
<0001> That's it.
<0002> There we go.
<0003> Hmph.
<0004> I'll be using a card.
<0005> I'll go with this card.
<0006> This, perhaps?
<0007> How's this?
<0008> I'm setting this down.
<0009> Should I put this here?
<0010> I'm laying down a card.
<0011> I hope this catches someone.
<0012> Then I'll go with this card.
<0013> My trump card.
<0014> Surprise.
<0015> I have this.
<0016> Hmph, fall before me.
<0017> Allow me to resume.
<0018> Good grief.
<0019> Let's continue.
<0020> I hate waiting.
<0021> These things happen.
<0022> No big deal.
<0023> Whatever.
<0024> I don't care.
<0025> Eat this.
<0026> Take this.
<0027> This is going to hurt!
<0028> Behave yourself!
<0029> Oww!
<0030> The nerve!
<0031> How dare you!
<0032> Kyaa.
<0033> What a relief.
<0034> Good grief.
<0035> Phew.
<0036> Not bad.
<0037> What? What's going on?
<0038> Ah... H-hold on!
<0039> W-where are you taking me?
<0040> Escort me properly!
<0041> No way.
<0042> I was negligent.
<0043> My goodness.
<0044> What are you doing?!
<0045> Prepare yourself.
<0046> You're in the way.
<0047> Out of the way.
<0048> Fight me.
<0049> I won't show mercy.
<0050> I'm ready.
<0051> You've got some nerve.
<0052> I'll make you regret this.
<0053> Fall before me!
<0054> Eat lead.
<0055> Eat this!
<0056> Here I go!
<0057> Geh.
<0058> Ngh.
<0059> I'm not done yet.
<0060> That hurts.
<0061> Cut it out!
<0062> Hold on!
<0063> That hurts!
<0064> Kyaa!
<0065> Not good enough.
<0066> You've got a ways to go.
<0067> Is that all you've got?
<0068> Oh, how simple.
<0069> Naturally.
<0070> My apologies.
<0071> Oh, it's over?
<0072> Do come again.
<0073> You'll pay for this.
<0074> This... doesn't bother me.
<0075> How dare you.
<0076> Ha... hahahaha.
<0077> I'll take these.
<0078> Well, not bad.
<0079> I accept.
<0080> Just what I was waiting for.
<0081> Just a trifle.
<0082> Hmph.
<0083> Heheh.
<0084> What? That much?
<0085> Oh no!
<0086> What the heck?
<0087> Ngh.
<0088> Someone set a trap!
<0089> Did you think I would be afraid?
<0090> Oh, it seems like something's here.
<0091> ...It's huge.
<0092> You're not as tough as you look.
<0093> I'll collect stars.
<0094> Well, I'll collect them right away.
<0095> So many is kind of a pain.
<0096> It's okay if I steal them, right?
<0097> I dislike savagery, but...
<0098> It's the same either way.
<0099> There's no need to hold back, right?
<0100> Hahaha... this has gotten fun.
<0101> A good decision.
<0102> I'm prepared.
<0103> Oh, greetings.
<0104> M-me?
<0105> I'm heading out.
<0106> Now then, let us begin.
<0107> Oh good grief.
<0108> Allow me to enjoy this.
<0109> The obvious outcome.
<0110> This is no big deal.
<0111> Are we done now?
<0112> I-it seems I won...
<0113> I don't have this yet.
<0114> This is pretty good.
<0115> Should I try using it?
<0116> Oh, how splendid.
<0117> You take care of this, alright?
<0118> You take it from here.
<0119> Don't mess up out there, okay?
<0120> I'm going to get some rest.
<0121> Understood.
<0122> Very nice.
<0123> Yes.
<0124> No.
<0125> What's this?
<0126> Whatever.
<0127> What is it?
<0128> Let's head out.
<0129> How will it go?
<0130> I'm going.
<0131> Greetings.
<0132> Ngh.
<0133> Very good.
<0134> Amazing!
<0135> Hmph.
<0136> Allow me to use this.
<0137> May I use this?
<0138> What a card!
<0139> This is a pretty good card.
<0140> Hmph! T-thanks, I guess...
<0141> Oh, greetings.
<0142> Give up on being a pilot already.
<0143> How dare you!
<0144> Isn't that dress a bit short?
<0145> Stop speaking in such a strange manner.
<0146> Children should go home.
<0147> You plane fanatics are all idiots!
<0148> You're a pilot too?
<0149> ...Whoa.
<0150> How vulgar...
<0151> A pervert has appeared.
<0152> Ah... I can't see anything.
<0153> Such a cheap flavor...
<0154> To... lose to a lowly beast!
<0155> I want this for my home.
<0156> This really was a nuisance.
<0157> They made such a stupid thing.
<0158> I'm not angry, okay?
<0159> What a shameless card!
<0160> I'm borrowing your power!
<0161> Eww... my clothes are a mess now!
<0162> The tea is served, it's going to be a perfect par- gyah?!
<0163> Such an overbearing presence, every time I see him...
<0164> So cool...
