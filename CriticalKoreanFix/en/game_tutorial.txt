Welcome to Orange Juice! Would you want to view a 4 minute gameplay tutorial? (RECOMMENDED)\nYou can view the video whenever from the Guide.

< TUTORIAL_00 >
Welcome to 100% Orange Juice! We will explain a few basics - if you wish, you can just skip over them.

< TUTORIAL_01 >
This is a 4-player board game where the usual goal is to reach "Norma" level 6 to win.

< TUTORIAL_02 >
You roll dice to move on a game board - different colored panels have different effects.

< TUTORIAL_03 >
This is a home panel. You always start in one, and must land on one to level up or to win the game.

< TUTORIAL_04 >
Each player has their own, numbered home and you can choose to stop there. You can visit any player's home with an exact roll, though.

< TUTORIAL_05 >
Your first objective is to gather 10 stars to level up, and then land on a home. After that you can choose whether to collect stars or fight battles to get more Wins for your next level-up.

< TUTORIAL_06 >
By the way, we recommend aiming for a star norma if you're unsure which to choose. You receive more stars every chapter, so you will never get stuck.

< TUTORIAL_07 >
Yellow panels are Bonus panels, and let you roll to gain stars. You will receive your current Level x rolled number stars (up to a multiplier of 3).

< TUTORIAL_08 >
Blue panels are Drop panels, and you will lose stars if you land on one. You will lose your current Level x rolled number stars (up to a multiplier of 5).

< TUTORIAL_09 >
Green is a Draw panel, and lets you draw a card.

< TUTORIAL_10 >
Red is an Encounter panel, and you will be forced to fight a wild enemy. If you win, you will receive Wins and stars.

< TUTORIAL_11 >
Purple is a Warp panel - it will take you to another random warp panel that has an exit.

< TUTORIAL_12 >
There are other, more advanced panels too... you will learn how they work as you play!

< TUTORIAL_13 >
If you run into another unit while moving, you get the opportunity to challenge them into a battle!

< TUTORIAL_14 >
You can hover over the unit portrait in the corner of the field to see the abilities of other units. They affect how good they are in battle.

< TUTORIAL_15 >
In battle, the attacker first rolls for damage, and if they have any +Attack bonus it's added to the roll.

< TUTORIAL_16 >
The defender can choose to Defend, which will lower the damage they take according to their roll, down to 1.

< TUTORIAL_17 >
If you choose Evade, the defender must roll higher than the attack roll to take no damage at all. Otherwise they take full damage.

< TUTORIAL_18 >
After surviving the first attack, the defender then gets a chance to attack back!

< TUTORIAL_19 >
If one of the players goes down to 0 HP, they suffer KO and the winner receives 50% of their held stars, and gains 2 Wins!

< TUTORIAL_20 >
Next, let's talk about cards! Each player chooses 10 cards to bring to the game, and they are shuffled together into the Center Deck, alongside 8 blank Hyper Cards.

< TUTORIAL_21 >
You should aim to bring cards that will help your chosen unit more than they will help your enemies.

< TUTORIAL_22 >
Each unit has a unique Hyper Card. If you draw a blank Hyper Card from the deck, it will turn into your unit's own Hyper Card. They usually have game-changingly powerful effects!

< TUTORIAL_23 >
Note that each card has a level from 1 to 5, marked on the left. You need to level up to the matching level to use the card. Most of them also cost stars to use (marked on the right).

< TUTORIAL_24 >
Many fields have 'Field Effects', which activate at certain intervals. You can hover over the 'Info' button to see field events and more.

< TUTORIAL_25 >
For example, the 'Charity' Field Effect lets each player draw a card from the Center Deck every 5 chapters.

< TUTORIAL_26 >
Once the first player reaches Norma level 4 in Versus mode, a powerful Boss will appear on the field, replacing all Encounter panels with Boss panels. Be careful to avoid fighting it!

< TUTORIAL_27 >
After each match you will receive some Stars as a reward, which you can use to purchase new cards and more in the Shop.

< TUTORIAL_28 >
When playing online or in Co-op mode, you will also receive Oranges which can be used to unlock various kinds of cosmetics in the Shop.

< TUTORIAL_29 >
If there is currently an event active, you can find more details on it by clicking the event banner in the main menu.

Please enjoy the game... and beware of Marie Poppo!
